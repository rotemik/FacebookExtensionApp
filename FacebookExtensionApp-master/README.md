## App main features

### Travel Diary
A feature designed to allow users to view their travel diary, which lists all the places where the user checked in.
This mode of presentation is intended to allow users to view their travels by country/city.
This feature also allows users to plan trips to places they have not visited.
Users can see the list of all countries they have visited, and a list of all cities they have visited in each country will appear when clicking on each country.
This allows users to conveniently view their past trips and gather information for planning trips to new destinations.

### Soulmate Founder
This feature allows users to find their "soul mate" from their friends list - the friend who has the most in common with the user.
Users will also be shown a breakdown of the criteria used to select that person from the list.
